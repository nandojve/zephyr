  ram-size:
    type: int
    required: true

      Size of USB dedicated RAM. STM32 SOC's reference
      manual defines a shared FIFO size.

  vbus-sensing:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enable VBUS sensing via the OTG controller's internal comparator.
      When set, the driver enables the HAL VBUS comparator and advertises
      the VBUS detection capability. The VBUS pin must also be included
      in pinctrl-0 to route the voltage to the comparator input.
