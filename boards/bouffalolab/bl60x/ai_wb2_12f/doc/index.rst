BL602 Development Board
#######################

Overview
********

BL602/BL604 is a Wi-Fi+BLE chipset introduced by Bouffalo Lab, which is used
for low power consumption and high performance application development.  The
wireless subsystem includes 2.4G radio, Wi-Fi 802.11b/g/n and BLE 5.0
baseband/MAC design.  The microcontroller subsystem includes a 32-bit RISC CPU
with low power consumption, cache and memory.  The power management unit
controls the low power consumption mode.  In addition, it also supports
various security features.  The external interfaces include SDIO, SPI, UART,
I2C, IR remote, PWM, ADC, DAC, PIR and GPIO.

The BL602 Development Board features a SiFive E24 32 bit RISC-V CPU with FPU,
it supports High Frequency clock up to 192Mhz, have 128k ROM, 276kB RAM,
2.4 GHz WIFI 1T1R mode, support 20 MHz, data rate up to 72.2 Mbps, BLE 5.0
with 2MB phy.  It is a secure MCU which supports Secure boot, ECC-256 signed
image, QSPI/SPI Flash On-The-Fly AES Decryption and PKA (Public Key
Accelerator).

Supported Features
==================

The board configuration supports the following hardware features:

+-----------+------------+-----------------------+
| Interface | Controller | Driver/Component      |
+===========+============+=======================+
| MTIMER    | on-chip    | RISC-V Machine Timer  |
+-----------+------------+-----------------------+
| PINCTRL   | on-chip    | pin muxing            |
+-----------+------------+-----------------------+
| UART      | on-chip    | serial port-polling   |
+-----------+------------+-----------------------+


The default configurations can be found in the Kconfig
:zephyr_file:`boards/risc/ai-wb2-12f/ai_wb2_12f_defconfig`.

System Clock
============

The BL602 Development Board is configured to run at max speed (192MHz).

Serial Port
===========

The ai_wb2_12f_ uses UART0 as default serial port.  It is connected to
USB Serial converter and port is used for both program and console.


Programming and Debugging
*************************

Debugging
=========

#. Jtag defaults for BL702 are as follow:
GPIO12 TMS
GPIO17 TDI
GPIO14 TCK
GPIO11 TDO


BL Flash tool
=============

The BL-602 have a ROM bootloader that allows user flash device by serial port.
There are some tools available at internet and this will describe one of them.

Samples
=======

#. Build the Zephyr kernel and the :ref:`hello_world` sample application:

   .. zephyr-app-commands::
      :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
      :board: ai_wb2_12f_
      :goals: build
      :compact:

#. To flash an image:

   #. Press BURN button or pull up GPIO8

   #. Press and release EN button or pull down EN pin temporarily

   #. Release BURN button or stop pulling GPIO8

   .. code-block:: console

      west flash

#. Run your favorite terminal program to listen for output. Under Linux the
   terminal should be :code:`/dev/ttyUSB0`. For example:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200

   string. Connection should be configured as follows by default:

      - Speed: 115200
      - Data: 8 bits
      - Parity: None
      - Stop bits: 1

   Then, press and release EN button

   .. code-block:: console
